## Features

### üèôÔ∏è City Simulation
- **AI Agent Citizens**: 1000 simulated Hong Kong citizens with diverse backgrounds (age, occupation, income, district)
- **Dynamic City Model**: Visual representation of Hong Kong districts with different zone types
- **Real-time Data Integration**: Simulated data collection and correlation analysis

### ü§ñ AI Agent System
- **Individual Decision Making**: Each citizen AI agent evaluates policies based on personal characteristics
- **Interactive Behavior**: Agents influence each other's decisions, creating realistic social dynamics
- **Adaptive Responses**: Agents adjust their support based on age, income, occupation, and personal priorities

### üìä Policy Analysis
- **10-Year Simulation**: Projects long-term impacts of proposed policies
- **Support Metrics**: Shows percentage of citizen support vs opposition
- **Decision Criteria**: Reveals the main factors AI agents consider when evaluating policies
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Identifies potential weak points and provides actionable recommendations

## How to Use

1. **Open the Application**: Open `index.html` in your web browser
2. **Enter Policy**: Type your policy or strategy in the text area (e.g., "Increase public housing by 20%")
3. **Run Simulation**: Click "Run 10-Year Simulation" to start the analysis
4. **View Results**: Review the simulation results including:
   - AI agent decision criteria
   - Public support percentage
   - Vulnerability points and recommendations
