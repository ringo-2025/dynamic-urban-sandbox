# Dynamic Urban Sandbox: Interactive Policy Simulation for Future Environments

A demo application for simulating policy impacts on Hong Kong's urban development through AI agent-based modeling.

## Features

### üèôÔ∏è City Simulation
- **AI Agent Citizens**: 1000 simulated Hong Kong citizens with diverse backgrounds (age, occupation, income, district)
- **Dynamic City Model**: Visual representation of Hong Kong districts with different zone types
- **Real-time Data Integration**: Simulated data collection and correlation analysis

### ü§ñ AI Agent System
- **Individual Decision Making**: Each citizen AI agent evaluates policies based on personal characteristics
- **Interactive Behavior**: Agents influence each other's decisions, creating realistic social dynamics
- **Adaptive Responses**: Agents adjust their support based on age, income, occupation, and personal priorities

### üìä Policy Analysis
- **10-Year Simulation**: Projects long-term impacts of proposed policies
- **Support Metrics**: Shows percentage of citizen support vs opposition
- **Decision Criteria**: Reveals the main factors AI agents consider when evaluating policies
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Identifies potential weak points and provides actionable recommendations

## How to Use

1. **Open the Application**: Open `index.html` in your web browser
2. **Enter Policy**: Type your policy or strategy in the text area (e.g., "Increase public housing by 20%")
3. **Run Simulation**: Click "Run 10-Year Simulation" to start the analysis
4. **View Results**: Review the simulation results including:
   - AI agent decision criteria
   - Public support percentage
   - Vulnerability points and recommendations

## Sample Policies to Test

- Increase public housing supply by 30% over 5 years
- Implement carbon tax of $100 per ton to reduce emissions
- Expand MTR network to cover all districts by 2030
- Introduce universal basic income for citizens below poverty line
- Mandate 50% renewable energy for all new buildings

## Technical Implementation

### AI Agent Modeling
- **Citizen Characteristics**: Age (20-80), occupation, income (20k-120k HKD), district
- **Decision Factors**: Personal priorities (housing, transport, environment, economy, healthcare, education)
- **Policy Evaluation**: Multi-factor analysis considering demographics and policy content

### Simulation Process
1. **Data Collection**: Simulates gathering Hong Kong real-time data
2. **Model Generation**: Creates city model with diverse AI agent population
3. **Policy Simulation**: Runs 10-year impact analysis with agent interactions
4. **Results Analysis**: Generates support metrics, criteria, and recommendations

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with real Hong Kong government data APIs
- More sophisticated agent interaction models
- Advanced visualization with 3D city representation
- Machine learning for improved policy impact prediction
- Multi-language support (Traditional Chinese)

## Smart Government Benefits

This sandbox enables:
- **Evidence-based Policy Making**: Test policies before implementation
- **Citizen Impact Assessment**: Understand how different demographics respond
- **Risk Mitigation**: Identify vulnerabilities early in the policy development process
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Demonstrate policy impacts to the public and legislators
